### Project Goals
This project will use the UK Biobank (>500,000 participants) and work with linked HES data, data collected as part of UK Biobank research assessments, and derived cardiac imaging measures. The aims of this project is to investigate associations of mediastinal radiotherapy with incident cardiac events and cardiac structure and function alterations defined from MRI scan using data from UK Biobank.

### Background: 
Patients with past cancer are at high risk of cardiovascular disease owing to high burden of shared risk factors, effects of the cancer itself, and harmful effects of cancer treatments. Improvement in cancer therapies have led to increase in number of people
surviving cancer. As cancer patients live to older ages, heart disease becomes a dominant cause of ill health and premature death in this cohort. Many cancer therapies are cardiotoxic. Patients with breast cancer are often exposed to three treatments which carry very high risk
of cardiotoxicity: anthracycline chemotherapy, trastuzumab, and mediastinal radiotherapy. 
<br/>
The aim of the project is to investigate associations of mediastinal radiotherapy with incident cardiac events and cardiac structure and function alterations defined from MRI scans. The study sample will comprise UK Biobank participants with past breast cancer. The following steps will be taken: 
<br/>
  1)  Define the subset of UK Biobank participants with past breast cancer using health record linkage. Support will be provided to define the code list.

  2)  Identify exposure status to radiotherapy â€“ using linked HES records. Support will be provided to define the code list.

  3)  Characterise demographics, vascular risk factor burden, prevalent cardiovascular disease, and heart MRI measures in individuals with past breast cancer, stratifying by radiotherapy exposure status. The heart MRI metrics are already extracted, and the candidate will be 
  supported in selecting six clinically important measures.

  4)  Ascertain incident myocardial infarction, stroke, and heart failure using linked HES records.

  5)  Run multivariable linear regression and Cox regression (select as appropriate) to examine association of each cancer treatment with a)heart MRI measures and b)incident events.

  6)  Write up thesis
<br/>

### Methodology
*	Multivariable linear regression 
* Cox regression
*	Competing risk regression 
* Fine Grey regression
<br/>
For the abovementioned steps, analytical algorithms will be developed in R, bash and/or Python piping resulting data between scripts, creating thus a seamless bioinformatics pipeline.
